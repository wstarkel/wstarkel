- 👋 Hi, I’m @wstarkel
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about data analysis and data science, and using these tools for educational data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the foundations of coding and how it can be applied to using educational data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to help better use all our education data (e.g., standardized tests) so the outcomes for public education can be maximized.
